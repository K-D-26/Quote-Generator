# Quote-Generator
A JavaScript based web project that displays a random quote from some famous authors using a quote api.


In this project, we basically have a window which shows a quote fetched from a quote api on loading the page. Also on refreshing, a new random quote gets generated and displayed on the screen of the user. The page is responsive.

Also in some case if the api is not working, we have a "quote.js" file in which some qoutes are stored. So, we can even get quotes from the local storeage if the api is not working.
